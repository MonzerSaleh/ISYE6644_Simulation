    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Toss two die and observe their sum. What is the expected number of tosses until the sum is 11??**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about this there is really only 2 events that lead to an 11, (5,6) & (6,5)    \n",
    "But the question ask how many tosses until this event, so really there's two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1**    \n",
    "The probability of a sum of 11 is 2/36, \n",
    "- where 2 is the number of successful sums of 11 and 36 is the total number of possibilities.\n",
    "- this is just 1/18\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2** This is much trickier.    \n",
    "Consider for example: For a single die, what is the expected number of tosses until we get 4?   \n",
    "Since P(4)=1/6 we $E[X=x]=1/6$ which leads to 1/1/6 or 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "So since P(11)=1/18 we compute 1/1/18 which is just 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could have also used a geometric distribution, where E[X]=1/p\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider a poisson with rate $\\lambda = 2$. Find the the distribution of the time between the 5th and 6th arrivals**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hinges on remembering that the time between events in a poisson is exponential. so $Exp(\\lambda=2)$. This is true for all events in a poisson process. (in other forms of this question it may ask for the pdf. ie $Exp(\\lambda=2)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}= 2e^{-2x}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes or No? If X and Y are independent exponential RVs, are they necessarily uncorrelated?** \n",
    "\n",
    "YES - Any RVs that are independent, must be uncorrelated  \n",
    "(Note however that the opposite is not always true! Uncorrelated RVs may not necessarily be independent)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes or No? A Poisson has stationary and independent increments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall a few things  \n",
    "- increments is like interarrival, it's the length of time/space between 2 events\n",
    "- the time between events is exponential and we know the exponential is memory less.    \n",
    "- Stationarity means that they have the same distribution   \n",
    "\n",
    "Final outcome: Yes, a poisson is stationary and independently increments\n",
    "\n",

    "### Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose X has PDF $f(x)=4x^3; \\; 0 \\lt x \\lt 1$. Find $E[(2/X)-3]$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional path is to integrate but this can be tedious   \n",
    "$E[(2/X)-3] = \\int_0^1 ((2/X)-3)4x^3 dx  $\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to observe that $E[(2/X)-3] = 2E[1/x]-3$ and this is much easier to integrate    \n",

    "**Suppose X has PDF $f(x)=3x^2; 0 \\le x \\le 1$ What's the pdf of the RV $e^X$**\n",
