    "**Description**   \n",
    "This course covers modeling of discrete-event dynamic systems and introduces methods for using these models to solve engineering design and analysis problems.  It'll be a mix of probability, statistics, computer science, and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work hard and play hard on a number of interesting topics.  Everything from a Prob/Stats bootcamp to the generation of random variables on a computer to the analysis of outputs from a simulation.    I tend to assign a lot of homework, but I promise that it's all reasonable.  We'll have two impossibly difficult midterms and a final, but you'll survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you're done with this course (if you are still walking), you'll be able to model, simulate, and analyze a variety of real-world processes.  Think the line at Disneyworld, or a complicated manufacturing system, or even stock options!\n",

    "Simulation is good to describe / analyze real or conceptual system behaviour. Ask \"what-if\" type questions. Aid in system design and optimization. It is most popular in Manufacturing industry. Used calculate the movement of parts of interation of system components; Evaluate part flow thru a system; Examine conflicting demand for resources; etc etc. Basically any system that looks at throughput (Queueing Problems). Disadvantages include: Not easy, Time consuming and costly, \n",

    "In this situation we will update the state of the system at fixed times, nh, for n = 0,1,2,…, where h is chosen appropriately. This is used in continuous-time models (e.g., differential equations) and models where data are only available at fixed times (e.g., at the end of every month). \n",

    "We will not use this in this course!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next-Event Time Advance**         \n",
    "In this scenario the clock is initialized at 0. All known future event times are determined and placed in the future events List (**FEL**), ordered by time. The clock advances to the most imminent event, then to the next most imminent event, etc. At each event, the system state and FEL are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system state can only change at event times. Nothing really happens between events. The simulation progresses by sequentially executing (dealing with) the most imminent event on the FEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by “dealing with”? The system state is updated, depending on what type of event it is (arrival, departure, etc.). For example, if it’s an arrival event, you may have to turn on an idle server, or add a new customer to the queue of a busy server. Now Update the FEL!\n",

    "- doing nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:     \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After guy arrives at a queue, typical simulation programs will immediately spawn the next arrival time. If this arrival time is significantly far enough in the future, we’ll simply put it at the “end” of the FEL (in terms of ordered execution times of the events).     \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If that next arrival turns out to happen before another event, e.g., a slow server finishing his current customer, then that next arrival must be inserted in the interior of the FEL (in terms of ordered execution times).\n",

    "disgusted and leave or switch to other lines? Then you have to delete or move entries in the FEL\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will need efficient list processing (e.g., linked lists) for the FEL.\n",
    "- Singly and doubly linked lists intelligently store the events in an array that allows the chronological order of the events to be accessed.\n",
    "- Such lists easily accommodate insertion, deletion, switching of events, etc.\n",
    "- Take a Computer Science course to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful about events that take place at the same time, e.g., a guy shows up at the same time that another guy finishes getting served. Simply establish ground rules for how to deal with ties. Every discrete-event simulation language maintains a FEL somewhere deep in its cold, cold heart.\n",
